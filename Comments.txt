If the stored procedures are not set, a signup will always succeed, but the user account will be inaccessible and 
the signup page will return an error, because the procedure userExists() is not defined.
It will also not create a user folder, because the loginUser() function fails. 
Therefore, the account should be deleted and re-made, or the folder of the user created manually.
